quran for android
a simple quran client for android
==================================

this is an extremely simple quran prototype for android (mainly was
written as a learning project to learn android development).  the hope is 
that if time permits, i can insha'Allah improve on it and make it better.

i have only tested it on an emulator.  it only looks good on a screen with a
width of 480, i haven't yet optimized it for smaller screens.

due to the limited resources on the android phone and the relatively large
size of the images (27mb for the whole mus7af), the best way to run this is
to first download the images ( http://labs.quran.com/androidquran/images.zip ) 
and then extract them to a quran directory in the root of your sd card.

the current behavior is that if you *don't* copy the images, then every page
will have to download from the server in order to be displayed.  upon
downloading a page, the code will attempt to copy it to a quran subdirectory
on the root of the sd card, so that future runs of the program don't have to
fetch this from the web.

for details about the images, please see:

patches, comments, etc are welcome.
