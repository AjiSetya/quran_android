while quran android is actively developed, it is (unfortunately) no longer open source. the reason for this comes back to people repeatedly breaking the rules and terms that we set for using quran android.

over the years, we've seen several examples (and there are certainly several more that we haven't seen). we've seen people adding an ad above and below each and every quran page, we've seen people taking our graphics, and people adding malware and publishing malware infested quran android versions.

### why is this a problem?

1. people republishing have typically done so to make money, and have almost always done so in a way that is not befitting of the book of Allah (example ad overlays while reading the Quran, etc).

2. credibility - when others re-publish our apps, we can't trust what they wil do with the data. we saw one instance of an app where the developer took some of our graphics for a quran app, and also had a bible app in the store - how do we know that the quran app is accurate? if mistakes are found by the user in those apps, people will not use our app in the future, thinking it's the same app as that of this user.

3. it is theft - not just idea theft, but monetary theft. quran android costs money to host on a monthly basis (between images, audio files, etc). when someone reuses our code, keeps pointing to our servers, and adds ads to make money off of the app, this is theft.

4. inability to get fixes and updates to other users - simply put, we can't know what these other people will do with the app in the future.

5. security - with the recent report of a published apk of quran with built in malware, there are no guarantee of what these rogue apps will do to people's devices. while we can't stop a dedicated person from reverse engineering the app and still being malicious, we can at least make it a little bit more difficult for them to do so.
